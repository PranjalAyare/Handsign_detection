# Handsign_detection
The Python-based handsign detection project utilizes computer vision techniques to identify and recognize hand gestures in real-time. It leverages machine learning algorithms and image processing to classify various hand signs, enabling applications in sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, and gesture-based control systems.
